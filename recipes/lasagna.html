  <h2><em>Nothing beats classic lasagna. And this is the easiest recipe you will ever make. It can be made ahead and it’s freezer-friendly too!</em></h2>
  <p>I have a friend on bedrest for the next few days and her only request from me was homemade lasagna.</p>
  <p>It’s a true classic and all but I asked if she wanted anything else – maybe something fancier? She said no. Just lasagna</p>
  <p>So here it is. Classic homemade lasagna, made the easiest way of all.</p>
  <p>20 min prep time.</p>
  <p>That’s it.</p>
  <p>And the end result?</p>
  <p>Well, <em>it’s perfection.</em></p>
